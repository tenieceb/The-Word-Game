# Overview

For this project, I developed a Wordle-inspired word guessing game in C++ to deepen my understanding of core programming concepts and the language’s syntax. The software demonstrates fundamental features such as variables, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, inheritance, and the use of standard template library (STL) data structures like vectors.


The purpose of writing this program was, not only to learn C++, but to practice designing object-oriented code, handle user input, implement game logic, and manage state across multiple game rounds. It helped me explore topics like virtual functions and code reuse through inheritance by building both single-player and multiplayer modes.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

The software was developted using Visual Studio IDE on Windows. I used the Microsoft C++ compiler (MSVC) and the C++17 standard to build and run the program.


The language used was c++, with the standard library for input/output streams, vectors, and algorithms. I avoided external libraries so I could focus on mastering the core language features and standard tools.
